## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a breaking vulnerability, please DO NOT report them as an issue on the github repository or in the Discord server or Telegram group.
Please DO send them to `support [at] pokehunt.xyz` or contact me privately and we will reply ASAP.
Finding vulnerabilities might be rewarded, however, if you want to be a bug bounty hunter please contact us beforehand. We monitor suspicious activity and might ban you if you have not contacted us.
